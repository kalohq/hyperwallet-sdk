This is a fork of https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hyperwallet-sdk/0.2.0 which was
the only source code available at the time.

Hyperwallet has since published on github
(https://github.com/hyperwallet/python-sdk) so we should clean up our fork and
make a pull request against the official repo.

## How to use
